        "\n",
        "*   ***Spatial Data Processing:*** Spatial data primarily exists in two formats—vector and raster—across different scales, from individual-level to aggregated data. Additionally, all spatial data contains non-spatial attributes. Before we map and analyze the data, spatial data often requires additional cleaning and preparations. Such processes include vector-raster conversions, spatial and non-spatial data merging, and performing overlays, aggregation, and generalization.\n",

        "\n",
        "*  ***Data Visualization and Mapping:*** Data visualizations with charts and maps are fundamental to spatial computing, allowing us to illustrate and interpret spatial patterns. While traditional static maps have long been integral to spatial science, cartographic science nowadays strongly advocates for web-based maps to facilitate user interactions, crowdsourced data collection, and the democratization of geospatial information.\n",

        "\n",
        "*   ***Spatial Data Analysis and Modeling:*** The core spatial analysis techniques, such as spatial autocorrelation, interpolation, clustering, and regression, enable us to examine spatial patterns, relationships, and interactions. Additionally, the recent boom in geospatial Artificial intelligence (GeoAI) equips us with accurate simulations and predictions of real-world spatiotemporal processes, further supporting data-driven decision-making.\n",
